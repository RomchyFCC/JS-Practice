    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    let age = 10;
    let age2 = age;
    age = 5;
    console.log(age, age2);

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = "lux";
    console.log(players, team);

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice(); //slice makes a copy of the array and does not change it because we didn't pass what we want slice to change

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);


    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];

    const team5 = Array.from(players);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object
    const person = {
        name: "me",
        number: 50
    }
    // with Objects
    const captain = person;
    captain.number = 40;
    console.table(person);
    // and think we make a copy:

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 100});
    console.table(cap2);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    //const cap3 = {...person};

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
