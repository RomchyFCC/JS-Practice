# My JavaScript exercises repository



### Exercise01



Write along from a course done by Gordon Zhu



---



### Exercise02



I had rewriten the write-along(without actually looking at the source code too much) project from previous course and added more functionality and made it into a project of mine. This is the best javascript learning experience so far.

I've moved this to https://github.com/RomchyFCC/Project01 and will maintain it there.

### Exercise03

Well more of a full blown course, I'm doing the javascript course on EDX.
Link: https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:PennX+SD4x+2T2017/course/

The folder will contain my sollutions so if you want to learn from the course, don't look at these.
