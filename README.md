# My JavaScript exercises repository



### Exercise01



Write along from a course done by Gordon Zhu



---



### Exercise02



I had rewriten the write-along(without actually looking at the source code) project from previous course and added more functionality and made it into a project of mine. This is the best javascript learning experience so far.

I've moved this to https://github.com/RomchyFCC/Project01 and will maintain it there.

### Exercise03

Well more of a full blown course, I'm doing the javascript course on EDX.
Link: https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:PennX+SD4x+2T2017/course/

The folder will contain my sollutions so if you want to learn from the course, don't look at these.

### Exercise04

Also a full course, because I like to keep stuff like this in folders.

---

### Exercise05

Coding along to this course: [Code your first game](https://www.udemy.com/code-your-first-game)

Really simple tutorial. Learned more about the canvas in html5 which is always nice :)

### Exercise06

Doing the basic tutorial on react from their doc page.
