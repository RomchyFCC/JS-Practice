# My JavaScript exercises repository

If I don't write the link to the course here, you can find all links in the blog repo in the courses table.


### Exercise01



Write along from a course done by Gordon Zhu

### Exercise02



I had rewriten the write-along(without actually looking at the source code) project from previous course and added more functionality and made it into a project of mine. This is the best javascript learning experience so far.

I've moved this to https://github.com/RomchyFCC/Project01 and will maintain it there.

### Exercise03

Well more of a full blown course, I'm doing the javascript course on EDX.
